PRO-C121: BACKGROUND MATTERS

In this project, I created a program that replaces the colour black with a certain image of a famous place in Cambodia.
> Note: You need to install some modules for this program to work

### How it works
Once you run the program, wait for a while and a popup should appear.

In the popup, the view from your camera (webcam) would be displayed and the colour black wouldd be masked with a certain image
