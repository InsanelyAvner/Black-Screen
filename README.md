# Black-Screen
PRO-C121: BACKGROUND MATTERS

In this project, I created a program that replaces the colour black with a certain image of a famous place in Cambodia.
> Note: You need to install some modules for this program to work

### How it works
Once you run the program, wait for a while and a popup should appear.

In the popup, the view from your camera (webcam) would be displayed and the colour black wouldd be masked with a certain image

## Getting Started
1. Go to this [link](https://github.com/InsanelyAvner/Black-Screen) to visit the Github Repository
2. Download all the files inside the repository. Then, open a folder containing them using your text editor
3. Install the required modules<br>For example: `pip install opencv-python`
4. Execute the code

You can now use this tool however you like ðŸ“·
